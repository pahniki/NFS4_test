Finaltask/Graduation work for Python Automation course.

Test Task
 
Please try to use OOP style, Linux knowledge, recap the slides from previous classes, and good luck!
Design a set of test cases for owner/permission/content modification testing of NFS4 file system.
Implement designed test cases as testing application (test suite). E.g. all tests are stored in “tests” folder and there is “main” file which run all tests and produces an output.
The results of the task are:
1.      Test documentation. Use the following format:
a.      Name of test case
b.      Description
c.      Steps
d.      Expected result of each step
2.      Source code of test suite
3.      Logs of the latest successful tests execution
 
 Test strategy you can find in "FinalTask_TestDocumentaion.doc" file.
 
 The mine idea is to transfer script files to a client machine and run it in needed for us sequence from server. 
 Test results will be loged inside of scripts folder and contain all the outcome of its work. 
 After all the tests are passsed the "log trasnfer" script is going to be executed. 
 It has to cpy logs of the system where he was running with selfmade logs to a server machine.
